<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/inbarraz/">Inbar Raz</a> has been teaching and lecturing about Internet Security and Reverse Engineering for nearly as long as he has been doing that himself. He started programming at the age of 9 on his Dragon 64. At 13 he got a PC, and promptly started Reverse Engineering at the age of 14. Through high-school he was a key figure in the Israeli BBS scene. He spent most of his career in the Internet and Data Security field, and the only reason heâ€™s not in jail right now is because he chose the right side of the law at an early age.</p>

<p>Inbar specializes in outside-the-box approach to analyzing security and finding vulnerabilities, using his extensive experience of over 25 years. He spent 3 years at Check Point, running the Malware and Security Research, and 2 years at PerimeterX, performing fascinating research on Bots and Web Automation attacks. Nowadays he is a Security Architect at Argus Cyber Security, protecting the automotive domain from hackers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/inbarraz/">Inbar Raz</a> has been teaching and lecturing about Internet Security and Reverse Engineering for nearly as long as he has been doing that himself. He started programming at the age of 9 on his Dragon 64. At 13 he got a PC, and promptly started Reverse Engineering at the age of 14. Through high-school he was a key figure in the Israeli BBS scene. He spent most of his career in the Internet and Data Security field, and the only reason he’s not in jail right now is because he chose the right side of the law at an early age.</p>

<p>Inbar specializes in outside-the-box approach to analyzing security and finding vulnerabilities, using his extensive experience of over 25 years. He spent 3 years at Check Point, running the Malware and Security Research, and 2 years at PerimeterX, performing fascinating research on Bots and Web Automation attacks. Nowadays he is a Security Architect at Argus Cyber Security, protecting the automotive domain from hackers.</p>
